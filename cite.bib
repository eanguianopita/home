For this purpose, we estimate seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) models and Granger causality tests with annual panel data for Canada, the United States and Mexico during the period 1980-2019. The main findings suggest that: 1) trade integration has a positive effect and productive specialization a negative one on business cycle synchronization of the economies; 2) intra-industrial trade predominates in the region; 3) trade and financial integration processes are complementary; 4) financial integration promotes productive specialization; and, 5) progresses in trade and financial integration within the region are heterogeneous.},

This paper examines the dynamics and the causal relationship between inbound tourism with overnight stays, origin country income and real exchange rates using quarterly data of Mexico during the period 1980:1 to 2019:4. We estimate both the number and date of structural breaks within variables using the Bai and Perron (2003) multiple structural break procedure. Toda-Yamamoto causality test were employed to determine the existence and the direction of causality between the variables. The main empirical findings suggest the existence of multiple structural breaks in the series and a one-way causality relationship from the US real GDP per capita to the international tourist arrivals to Mexico. We conclude that the neoliberal process contributes significantly to the growth of international tourism due to the minimu, protectionist barriers of the Mexican government.},

The internal factors are related to the economic policy decisions implemented during the period 2018 to 2020, the heterogeneity of the responses of sub-national governments to contain the economic effects of the pandemic and its effects on production
and employment levels. A forecast is presented for the main indicators of the Mexican economy, as well as the potential risks that could limit economic recovery.},
