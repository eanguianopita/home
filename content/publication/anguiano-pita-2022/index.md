abstract: 'This article analyzes the role of trade and financial integration, productive
  specialization and monetary policies in the synchronization of business cycles in
  North America from a long-run perspective. For this purpose, we estimate seemingly
  unrelated regression (SUR) models and Granger causality tests with annual panel
  data for Canada, the United States and Mexico during the period 1980-2019. The main
  findings suggest that: 1) trade integration has a positive effect and productive
  specialization a negative one on business cycle synchronization of the economies;
  2) intra-industrial trade predominates in the region; 3) trade and financial integration
  processes are complementary; 4) financial integration promotes productive specialization;
  and, 5) progresses in trade and financial integration within the region are heterogeneous.'
