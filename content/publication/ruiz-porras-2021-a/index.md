abstract: In this study we investigate the possible cointegration and direction of
  causality between financial development, trade openness, and economic growth in
  NAFTA countries using panel data from 1990 to 2017. The panel-data cointegration
  test is used to examine the existence of long-run relationships and long-run elasticities
  are estimated by Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary
  Least Squares (DOLS). Further,
