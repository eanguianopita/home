abstract: The literature concerning tourism forecasting points out the role played
  by origin country income and real exchange rates in affecting international tourism
  flows. This paper examines the dynamics and the causal relationship between inbound
  tourism with overnight stays, origin country income and real exchange rates using
  quarterly data of Mexico during the period 1980:1 to 2019:4. We estimate both the
  number and date of structural breaks within variables using the Bai and Perron (2003)
  multiple structural break procedure. Toda-Yamamoto causality test were employed
  to determine the existence and the direction of causality between the variables.
  The main empirical findings suggest the existence of multiple structural breaks
  in the series and a one-way causality relationship from the US real GDP per capita
  to the international tourist arrivals to Mexico. We conclude that the neoliberal
  process contributes significantly to the growth of international tourism due to
  the minimu, protectionist barriers of the Mexican government.
