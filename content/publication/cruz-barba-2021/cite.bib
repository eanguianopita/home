 abstract = {The literature concerning tourism forecasting points out the role played by origin country income and real exchange rates in affecting international tourism flows. This paper examines the dynamics and the causal relationship between inbound tourism with overnight stays, origin country income and real exchange rates using quarterly data of Mexico during the period 1980:1 to 2019:4. We estimate both the number and date of structural breaks within variables using the Bai and Perron (2003) multiple structural break procedure. Toda-Yamamoto causality test were employed to determine the existence and the direction of causality between the variables. The main empirical findings suggest the existence of multiple structural breaks in the series and a one-way causality relationship from the US real GDP per capita to the international tourist arrivals to Mexico. We conclude that the neoliberal process contributes significantly to the growth of international tourism due to the minimu, protectionist barriers of the Mexican government.},
