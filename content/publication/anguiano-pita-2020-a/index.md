abstract: 'The aim of this paper is to study the dynamics of the integration process
  of the bond, interbank, currency and stock markets of the NAFTA region. For this
  purpose, we use the generalized dynamic factor model originally proposed by Forni,
  Hallin, Lippi and Reichlin (2005) and representative series of monthly returns of
  the analyzed markets for the period from January 1995 to December 2017. The main
  results suggest that: 1) There are asymmetries in the size of the markets; 2) there
  is evidence of structural breaks; 3) common factors exist among the financial markets;
  4) the markets have differentiated levels of integration; and 5) the currency and
  stock markets are the most sensitive to the common components. These findings may
  be useful to analyze the evolution of NAFTA and to propose economic and financial
  regional policies.'
