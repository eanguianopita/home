abstract: "We study the dynamics, volatilities, and interrelationships between oil\
  \ prices and economic activity in Mexico. The main findings suggest that: 1) variations\
  \ in economic activity are more correlated to MAYA oil prices than to MME oil prices;\
  \ 2) the VAR (1)-CCC(1,1)-TGARCH (1) model with a multivariate Student's t distribution\
  \ can describe jointly the series analyzed; 3) there are direct interrelationships\
  \ between the volatilities of the series; and, 4) there are leverage effects on\
  \ the volatilities. We use monthly series of the IGAE indicator and MAYA and MME\
  \ oil prices for the period 1993M01-2019M12."
