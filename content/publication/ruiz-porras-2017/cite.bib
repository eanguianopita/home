 abstract = {We study the interest rates, the exchange rates and the prices in the NAFTA region. We also assess the potential synchronization of such time-series. The results suggest that: 1) the degree of synchronization, measured in terms of cointegration relationships, oscillates between 25 and 50 percent; 2) there is some synchronization of the national series of Mexico and the United States; 3) the dynamics of the series have been relatively independent among the three countries; 4) the series has undergone structural changes; and 5) the changes have tended to coincide with the Mexican crisis of 1995 and the US crisis of 2008. The study uses monthly series for the period between January 1992 and February 2015.},
