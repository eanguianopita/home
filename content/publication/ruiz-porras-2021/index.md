abstract: 'We study the interdependence between oil prices and economic activity in
  Mexico using an analysis of static and dynamic spillovers in the time and frequency
  domains. The main findings show that: 1) The relationships between oil prices and
  economic activity have fluctuated over time; 2) variations in oil prices have short-run
  effects and their volatilities have long-run effects on economic activity; 3) MAYA
  oil prices have the main interdependences with economic activity; 4) the highest
  net spillovers between oil prices and economic activity occurred between April 2009
  and June 2012. The study uses a series of variations and monthly volatilities of
  the spot oil prices MAYA, WTI, and Brent, and the IGAE indicator from February 1993
  to December 2019.'
