 abstract = {We study the integration of the money, currency and stock markets of the NAFTA region. The study uses unit-root tests and dynamic correlations. The results show that: 1) There are not always long-run trends towards the integration of the financial markets; 2) the integration of money markets, unlike the stock and the currency ones, increased during the global crisis; 3) the stock markets are the most integrated ones and the money markets are the least integrated; and 4) financial integration between United and Mexico has gradually decreased. We use monthly data of interest rates, exchange rates and stock indices for the period from
January 1995 to December 2016.},
