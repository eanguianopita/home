abstract: 'We study the integration of the money, currency and stock markets of the
  NAFTA region. The study uses unit-root tests and dynamic correlations. The results
  show that: 1) There are not always long-run trends towards the integration of the
  financial markets; 2) the integration of money markets, unlike the stock and the
  currency ones, increased during the global crisis; 3) the stock markets are the
  most integrated ones and the money markets are the least integrated; and 4) financial
  integration between United and Mexico has gradually decreased. We use monthly data
  of interest rates, exchange rates and stock indices for the period from January
  1995 to December 2016.'
