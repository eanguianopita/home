abstract: 'We study the integration of the money, currency and stock markets of the
  NAFTA region. The study uses unit-root and endogenous structural change tests and
  dynamic correlations.The results show that: 1) The financial integration processes
  have been unstable in the region;2) all the markets experienced structural changes;
  3) there are not necessarily processes toward the integration of the markets; and,
  4) financial integration processes have been heterogeneous among the markets and
  the countries. We use monthly series representative of the financial markets for
  the period from January 1995 to January 2019.'
