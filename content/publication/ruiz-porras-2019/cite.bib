 abstract = {We study the integration of the money, currency and stock markets of the NAFTA region. The study uses unit-root and endogenous structural change tests and dynamic correlations.The results show that: 1) The financial integration processes have been unstable in the region;2) all the markets experienced structural changes; 3) there are not necessarily processes toward the integration of the markets; and, 4) financial integration processes have been heterogeneous among the markets and the countries. We use monthly series representative of the financial markets for the period from January 1995 to January 2019.},
