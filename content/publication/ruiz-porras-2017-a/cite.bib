 abstract = {We study the changes in interest rates, exchange rates and prices in Mexico, Canada and the United States with twelve multivariate GARCH models. The results suggest that: 1) models of the DBEKK type are the best ones to describe the series of each country; 2) the CCC model is the best one to describe the series of the region; 3) there are some relationships and interrelations at the regional level, but many at the national one; 4) these relationships are more relevant to Mexico than for the other countries; 5) the inflation of Canada cannot be modelled; and 6) good and bad news have asymmetric impacts on the volatility of the series. The study uses monthly series for the period between February 1992 and February 2015.},
