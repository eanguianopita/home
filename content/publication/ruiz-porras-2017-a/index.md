abstract: 'We study the changes in interest rates, exchange rates and prices in Mexico,
  Canada and the United States with twelve multivariate GARCH models. The results
  suggest that: 1) models of the DBEKK type are the best ones to describe the series
  of each country; 2) the CCC model is the best one to describe the series of the
  region; 3) there are some relationships and interrelations at the regional level,
  but many at the national one; 4) these relationships are more relevant to Mexico
  than for the other countries; 5) the inflation of Canada cannot be modelled; and
  6) good and bad news have asymmetric impacts on the volatility of the series. The
  study uses monthly series for the period between February 1992 and February 2015.'
