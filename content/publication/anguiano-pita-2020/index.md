abstract: 'This study examines the relationship between financial development and
  economic growth in the North American region. For this purpose, it uses the generalized
  dynamic factor model proposed by Forni et al. (2005) and annual data from the United
  States, Canada, and Mexico for the period 1980-2017. The findings suggest that:
  i) there are common factors among the financial markets and economies of the region
  despite their asymmetries in size; ii) economic growth rates are sensitive to common
  components; iii) the causal relationship between financial development and economic
  growth depends on the financial indicators considered. The findings can be useful
  to analyze the integration process in North America and to propose regional policies.'
