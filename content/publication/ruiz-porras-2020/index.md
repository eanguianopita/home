abstract: This document provides an account of the economic effects of the COVID-19
  pandemic in Mexico. In particular, it describes the main external and internal factors
  that have led to the current state of the Mexican economy. The external factors
  include the effects of social distancing policies on supply chains, the contraction
  of international trade and the collapse of oil prices. The internal factors are
  related to the economic policy decisions implemented during the period 2018 to 2020,
  the heterogeneity of the responses of sub-national governments to contain the economic
  effects of the pandemic and its effects on production and employment levels. A forecast
  is presented for the main indicators of the Mexican economy, as well as the potential
  risks that could limit economic recovery.
