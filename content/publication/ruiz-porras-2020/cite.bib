 abstract = {This document provides an account of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. In particular, it describes the main external and internal factors that have led to the current state of the Mexican economy. The external factors include the effects of social distancing policies on supply chains, the contraction of international trade and the collapse of oil prices. The internal factors are related to the economic policy decisions implemented during the period 2018 to 2020, the heterogeneity of the responses of sub-national governments to contain the economic effects of the pandemic and its effects on production
and employment levels. A forecast is presented for the main indicators of the Mexican economy, as well as the potential risks that could limit economic recovery.},
