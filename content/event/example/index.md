location: Universidad de Guadalajara
abstract: An analysis of the changes that the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has generated in Mexico's trade and financial integration with its trading partners was presented. The main conclusion of this talk is that, two years after its entry into force, the USMCA has not generated significant changes in Mexico's trade patterns, nor has it accelerated the process of financial integration in the region.
