I am  a PhD candidate in Economic Studies at Universidad de Guadalajara (Mexico), specializing in international macroeconomics, econometrics of high-dimensional models, and financial development. 

My current research focuses in the trade and financial relationships in North America, and their macroeconomic implications. I also work on the relationship between energy prices and economic activity in Mexico. I have a particular interest in business cycles analysis. 

I most recently taught undergraduated and graduated Econometrics courses, and Applied Time Series Econometrics. I am teaching Financial Econometrics in the fall of 2022. 

The recent versions of my manuscripts are below. You can reach me at email if you want.
