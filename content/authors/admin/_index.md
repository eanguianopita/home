I am a PhD Economist, working as a research assistant at the Jalisco Economy Platform at Universidad de Guadalajara (Mexico). I defended my doctoral dissertation at Universidad de Guadalajara in November 2022. 

In my dissertation I analyze the effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and globalization in the trade and financial relationships between Canada, the U.S., and Mexico. 

My research interests are International Macroeconomics, Development Economics, and Applied Econometrics. 

I will be on the job market during the 2022-2023 academic year and I will be available for virtual interviews at the ASSA Job Market. 

You can reach me on je.ptt[at]hotmail.com.

The publication versions of my manuscripts are below.
